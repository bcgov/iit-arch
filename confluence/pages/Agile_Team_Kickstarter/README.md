Training is available through the exchange lab to get teams acquainted with the platform; a good primer is <a href="https://developer.gov.bc.ca/What-Is-OpenShift">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://developer.gov.bc.ca/ExchangeLab-Course:-Openshift-101">https://developer.gov.bc.ca/ExchangeLab-Course:-OpenShift-101</a></p><p>The landing page for the private cloud service is here: <a href="https://cloud.gov.bc.ca/private-cloud/">https://cloud.gov.bc.ca/private-cloud/</a></p><p>Namespace provisioning can be found here: <a href="https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/public-landing">https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/public-landing</a></p><p>Information on resource tuning for OpenShift Namespaces can be found here: <a href="https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/application-resource-tuning/">https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/application-resource-tuning/</a></p><p>The <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/activities">RedHat learning portal</a> is a great resource to learn more about the platform, and they also provide a sandbox to 'learn by doing'.</p><p>Some of the more important concepts to understand up front are:</p><ul><li>Image streams, builds &amp; tagging</li><li>Network policy settings to allow pods communicate internally and to the web via routes,</li><li>How to get deployments to listen to tags and/or configuration changes (eventually on repo events like pull requests)</li><li>Tuning, health checks, resource allocation and tuning, and pod scaling</li></ul><h3>OpenShift QuickStart Application</h3><p>Our friends and collaborators in the Forestry Suite of Applications Modernization Program have created an application template that includes a Typescript shell application with a deployment pipeline to the OpenShift platform with an option to include a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database and leveraging the backup container provided by the BC DevExchange.&nbsp; This is a great resource to get product teams up and running.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/bcgov/nr-quickstart-typescript">https://github.com/bcgov/nr-quickstart-typescript</a></p><h3>Public Cloud</h3><p>BC Government has endorsed several public cloud services and provides quickstart guides and sample applications!</p><p><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/cloud-computing-in-the-bc-government#explore">https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/cloud-computing-in-the-bc-government#explore</a></p><p>Approved AWS services can be found here: <a href="https://developer.gov.bc.ca/AWS-Services">https://developer.gov.bc.ca/AWS-Services</a></p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>Source code should be stored in a GitHub repository in the &quot;bcgov&quot; tenancy.</p><p>Access management for the bcgov GitHub tenancy can be found here: <a href="https://just-ask.developer.gov.bc.ca/">https://just-ask.developer.gov.bc.ca/</a></p><p>NRM specific guidance on Github is here: <a href="https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/display/AR/Source+Code+Repositories">Source Code Repositories</a></p><h3>Authentication and Identity</h3><p>Most NRM digital products leverage the OCIO SSO service that is backed by Keycloak.</p><p><a href="https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests">https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests</a></p><p><a href="https://oidc.gov.bc.ca/auth/">https://oidc.gov.bc.ca/auth/</a></p><h3>Secrets Management</h3><p>The platform services team operates a Vault service.&nbsp;</p><p>It is described here: &nbsp;<a href="https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/vault-secrets-management-service/">https://beta-docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/vault-secrets-management-service/</a></p><p>Access to the service is here: <a href="https://vault.developer.gov.bc.ca/ui/vault/auth?with=token">https://vault.developer.gov.bc.ca/ui/vault/auth?with=token</a></p><h3>Security and Privacy</h3><p>It's important that teams engage with the NRM Security and Privacy teams early and often.&nbsp;

For visibility, collaboration and maintainability modern teams are moving away from Jenkins towards GitHub actions.</p><p>It is strongly recommended that code be submitted using a Pull Request.&nbsp; Automated testing can and should replace manual UAT wherever practical.</p><p>NRM has a modern CI/CD template using GitHub Actions: <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/nr-quickstart-typescript">https://github.com/bcgov/nr-quickstart-typescript</a></p><h3>Application Programming Interfaces (API's)</h3><p>We recommend adopting an &quot;API First&quot; philosophy for application development, where teams both build and consume their API's.</p><p>BC Government has published a set of API Guidelines here: <a href="https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines">https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines</a></p><p>Information on the corporate API gateway can be found here: <a href="https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Developer-Tools/API-Gateway-(powered-by-Kong-CE)">https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Developer-Tools/API-Gateway-(powered-by-Kong-CE)</a></p><p>The Architecture team has sample APIs as a kick-starter, dev teams can choose from them and start adding business logic and not worry about boilerplate stuff, more information is available here. (<a href="https://github.com/bcgov/nr-arch-templates/tree/main/apis">https://github.com/bcgov/nr-arch-templates/tree/main/apis</a>).</p><h3>Database and Data Design</h3><p>Most of the teams working on OpenShift are choosing a flavor of PostgreSQL to persist data for their application.</p><p>Some points of consideration are:</p><ul><li>What type of data are you persisting as part of your application?&nbsp; Are you storing geospatial data?&nbsp; Audio and/or video?</li><li>What are your preferred integration patterns?</li><li>Do you have any requirements, for example, to replicate data to the BC Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)?</li><li><span><span class="unbalanced-text">What are the requirements for consistency, availability and partitioning?</span></span></li></ul><p>For NRM guidance specific to data and database design, please visit this space: <a href="https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/display/NRMDDDG/NRM+Data+and+Database+Development+Guidelines">NRM Data and Database Development Guidelines</a></p><p>Database backups can be setup using the backup container image;

The service is billed monthly to the highwatermark of the storage your team consumes in their S3 bucket at $0.07/GB/Month.&nbsp; To get an S3 object storage bucket, contact the <a href="https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/display/OPTIMIZE/NRS+Object+Storage">Optimize team</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/bcgov/common-object-management-service">COMS (Common Object Management Service)</a> is an emerging common component that leverages the object storage solution.&nbsp; The advantage of this component is that it includes the ability to tag and add metadata, and integrates with BC Government's standard identity providers (IDIR, BCeID).&nbsp; To learn more, attend the <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/common-service-showcase/">Common Services Showcase</a> team sprint reviews or contact the team via <a>email</a>.</p><p>An emerging companion to the Common Object Management Service being built by the Common Services team is <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bcbox">BCBox</a>, which is a hosted solution that uses the COMS API to allow users to upload, tag and share files using any <a href="https://openid.net/connect/"> OIDC </a>compliant authentication mechanism.</p><h3>Design Guidance</h3><p><span style="color: rgb(36,36,36);">General resources for Agile designers at Digital Government (BC Visual Identity, Official BC Design System, Web Style Guide, Content Design Guidance, UX Research Guidance, Service Design Playbook) can be found here:<br /></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(36,36,36);"><a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/resources#:~:text=Read%20the%20playbook-,For%20Designers,-B.C.%20Visual">https://digital.gov.bc.ca/resources#:~:text=Read%20the%20playbook-,For%20Designers,-B.C.%20Visual</a></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(36,36,36);">BC Parks has extended their Design Guide to include the use of the BC Sans font and other additions specific to their program:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(36,36,36);"><a href="https://bcgov.github.io/bcparks/design-guides">https://bcgov.github.io/bcparks/design-guides</a></span></p><h3>Front End Frameworks</h3><p>Many agile teams are using a flavor of Javascript framework for their front end development (Angular, Vue, React etc).&nbsp; We recommend you pick the framework that works best for the team, and <strong><em>if you are developing a suite of applications for your program area, harmonize across the suite </em></strong>where that makes sense.&nbsp; This will minimize risk associated with changes to the team and enable other developers to work with your code.</p><h3>Web Mapping Frameworks</h3><p>A comparison of web mapping frameworks in use in BC Government can found here: <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/">https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/</a></p><h3>Back End Languages</h3><p>Similar to front end frameworks, we recommend you choose a development language that best suits the team and the business challenge you are working on.&nbsp;<em><strong> If you are developing a suite of applications for your program area, harmonize across the suite</strong></em> where that makes sense.&nbsp; This will minimize risk associated with changes to the team and enable other developers to work with your code.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many languages in use by agile teams across government, the most popular being Go, Python, Java, Javascript and Typescript.&nbsp;

We recommend collaborating with the architecture team during any architectural spikes or any significant architectural decisions.&nbsp; Our collective experience and connectedness across the community can typically provide value for the team.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Q. </strong>Do I have to use OpenShift to host my application?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> No.&nbsp; We would generally like new applications to be running in a containerized or serverless hosting architecture.&nbsp; OpenShift is a strong option for teams starting out given the maturity of the platform and the surrounding community, as is the AWS Public Cloud Service, both operated by BC Government teams.&nbsp; Following cloud native design principles will help ensure that your application workload is portable between hosting platforms.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Can I pass my application off to an ops team so the team can work on new apps?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> We generally follow the &quot;you build it, you run it&quot; philosophy, and therefore recommend you build a sustainment plan into your application roadmap.&nbsp; Adhering as closely as possible to the <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 Factor</a> principles is a great way to promote a sustainable, cloud native build.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
